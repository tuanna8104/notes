Same format as Linear Programming, but some of variables is integer.

Model:
- Decision Variables
- Constraints
- Objectives

Branch and bound:
- Bounding: finding an optimistic relaxation
- Branching: splitting the problem in subproblems

Linear relaxation:
- Worse than best => prune
- Integral => update best
- Otherwise, two subproblems: x <= floor(f) and x>= ceil(f), repeat algorithm on the subproblems

Modeling techniques
- need good linear relaxation

Big-M Transformation
x <> y => x <= y -1 || x >= y + 1 => x <= y - 1 + bM && x >= y + 1 + (1-b)M (b: 0 || 1) (M: big integer)
=> not good linear relaxation for graph coloring
=> Better: 
x(b=0) + y(b=0) <= 1
x(b=1) + y(b=1) <= 1
x(b=2) + y(b=2) <= 1
x(b=3) + y(b=3) <= 1

Cutting Planes:
- valid: not remove any feasible solution
- helps: cuts the optimal solution to the linear relaxation
How to find these cuts:
- Look inside the tableau
