Same format as Linear Programming, but some of variables is integer.

Model:
- Decision Variables
- Constraints
- Objectives

Branch and bound:
- Bounding: finding an optimistic relaxation
- Branching: splitting the problem in subproblems

Linear relaxation:
- Worse than best => prune
- Integral => update best
- Otherwise, two subproblems: x <= floor(f) and x>= ceil(f), repeat algorithm on the subproblems

Modeling techniques
- need good linear relaxation
