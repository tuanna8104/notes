Convex Set (Convex Combination)
intersection of a set of half spaces: polyhedron, finite => polytope
n-1 : Hyperplane, 0: vertex
Optimal Solution is one of vertices

Naive Algorithm:
Find all basic feasible solution => find best

Simplex Algorithm:
* Move to another BFS:
- Select a non-basic variable with negative coefficient: entering variable
- Introduce this variable in the basis by removing a basic variable: leaving variable
- Perform Gaussian elimination
=> Local move: swapping, called: "pivoting" pivot(e, l)
Maintain feasibility: arg-min(b(i)/-a(ie))

* Check if a BFS is optimal:
if all coefficient in objective function is positive

* If coefficient in objective function is negative, but in all constraints, it is positive => optimize infinitely => wrong model
Add lexicographic when choose the entering variable and the leaving variable or perturbation method

* Find my first BFS: Add artifical variables => Find a basic feasible solution => return to original problem.

Matrix Notation:
A(b)*x(b) + A(n)*x(n) = B
=> x(b) = B' - A'(n)*x(n), feasible if b' >= 0
* Cost: c(x) = c(b)*x(b) + c(n)*x(n)
c(x) = c(b)*A(b)^-1*b + (c - c(b)*A(b)^-1*A)x
Pie (Simplex Multipers) = c(b)*A(b)^-1 => c(x) = Pie*b + (c - Pie*A)x
The Basis is Optimal If c>= PieA

The Tableau:
=> good representation, but in spare matrix, need other efficient methods.

Duality derivation
*Primal: min, Ax >= b
*Dual: max, yA <= c;
