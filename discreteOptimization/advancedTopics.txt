1. Scheduling with Constraint Programming
Minimize project duration subject to a) precedence constraints b) disjunctive constraints

Jobshop Scheduling:
task T, duration d(T), task excutes on a machine m(T) - not overlap, precedence constraints (b,a) in jobs
=> Minimize project completion time
Machine handle task sequentially => A solution find an ordering of the tasks on each machine

Feasibilty of Disjunctive Constraints: Olog(N^2), preemptive scheduling => O(nlog(n))
Disjunctive Pruning.

Basic strategy: chooose a machine, sequence that machine, repeat
Which machine? first-fail principles: tightest machine
Which task? First, last or as tight as possible
