1. Scheduling with Constraint Programming
Minimize project duration subject to a) precedence constraints b) disjunctive constraints

Jobshop Scheduling:
task T, duration d(T), task excutes on a machine m(T) - not overlap, precedence constraints (b,a) in jobs
=> Minimize project completion time
Machine handle task sequentially => A solution find an ordering of the tasks on each machine
